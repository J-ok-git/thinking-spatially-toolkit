## Who's Who

List of who we are. Maybe a brief blurb about why people might contact us?

## Open Hours

Each branch of Stanford University Library operates their own unique hours based on space and staffing resources. Below is information about the open hours for the Stanford Libraries' map and GIS team branches.

### Branner Earth Science Library

Information about [Branner Library's open hours\*](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/branner-earth-sciences-library-map-collections) can be found on the Branner Library homepage. Hours could be affected by holidays or other events, so be sure to check open hours during the week of your planned visit.

_\*Note the difference in hours for reference (being able to talk with a specialist about your question or project), and library/circulation (being able to study and check out material)._

### David Rumsey Map Center

Similar to Branner Library, information about the [David Rumsey Map Center's open hours](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/david-rumsey-map-center) can be found on the DRMC homepage. Hours are subject to change in response to events and classes that might take place in the center, so its always best to check during the week of your planned visit.

Open hours at the David Rumsey Map Center and meant for drop-in visits, but not for viewing and handling material. If you would like to make an appointment to view material at the DRMC during a convenient time you can either [email the David Rumsey Map Center](mailto:rumseymapcenter@stanford.edu) (rumseymapcenter@stanford.edu), or [initiate a request for material using Aeon](#).

### Stanford Geospatial Center

The Stanford Geospatial Center is located at Branner Library, where you will find computer workstations and resources for cartography and GIS. While the hours for Branner Library can be used for the SGC, consultations with staff can be made in advance using the [appointment links on the SGC homepage](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/stanford-geospatial-center).

## Slack

[Stanford Geospatial Center's Slack Workspace](https://stanford-geospatial.slack.com/) is a great resource for asking questions and getting answers from the collective wisdom of it's users. Using the link above, sign in with your Stanford credentials to ask questions, get updates about events, and stay in the loop about job postings or other opportunities.

<b>PLEASE DO NOT SEND PARALLEL REQUESTS</b> <br>
If you feel that your question is meant for more than one person listed below, please send a single email to multiple recipients to avoid uneccesary duplication of efforts before setting up a consultation.

Several members of the Stanford Libraries map and GIS team offer consultation hours, which can be found in the staff listings on each of the home pages below. The full list of research support specialists from Stanford Libraries can be found on the [Library's Subject Specialists page](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/stanford-geospatial-center).
