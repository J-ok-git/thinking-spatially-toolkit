## Why Consider Spatial Information?

## Primary formats

Spatial resources come in three primary formats: physical material, digital map images, and geospatial datasets and webmaps.

### Physical maps, atlases, and globes
Most of our physical maps are housed in two libraries: the **David Rumsey Map Center** and **Branner Earth Science Library & Map Collections**. The Rumsey Center primarily specializes in rare and historic material that needs special care and must be viewed by appointment in the center. Branner primarily houses more contemporary (20th c. and newer) material which can usually be checked out. Depending on your research topic you may find useful maps in both collections. Library staff in both branches are available to help you locate and work with relevant collection material regardless of where it is physically stored.

### Digital images of maps
Digital map images can be used in a variety of ways and incorporated into web-based interactives, presentations, and storytelling platforms. 

Digital map images are even more useful when they have been georeferenced, meaning that information about the location of the place represented on the map has been incorporated into the digital file. This enables mapmaking software to correctly layer the map image over a contemporary base map so it can be combined with other geospatial information. 

Much of the material in our collections has been scanned and the images made available for use in various applications. We do not yet have digital images for everything in the collections but new material is added on an ongoing basis. 

Some collections are digital only, and Stanford does not possess the physical items. These images are acquired through *digital philanthropy*, where owners of maps allow us to use images of their collection materials.

Library staff can help you locate existing digital map images, get material scanned, georeference map images if necessary, and select and learn to use the right software tools for your project.

### Geospatial datasets and web maps 
Accessible through the Earthworks data portal, Stanford's collections include over 100k spatial datasets and cartographic resources, with over 60,000 of those freely available under permissive licensing. Through licensing agreements the **Stanford Geospatial Center** provides access to additional external datasets like Planet.com’s daily image of the Earth and those provided by SimplyAnalytics, a web-based mapping application using thousands of U.S. demographic, business, and marketing variables. Library and Stanford Geospatial Center staff are available to help you find and use relevant datasets, employ related tools like geocoding services, and select and learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to create maps and data visualizations.
