# Cartographic Resources at Stanford
Stanford has an exceptional collection of cartographic resources for use in scholarship. 

These resources come in three primary formats: physical material, digital map images, and geospatial datasets and webmaps.

---

## Primary formats

### Physical maps, atlases, and globes
Most of our physical maps are housed in two libraries: the **David Rumsey Map Center** and **Branner Earth Science Library & Map Collections**. The Rumsey Center primarily specializes in rare and historic material that needs special care and must be viewed by appointment in the center. Branner primarily houses more contemporary (20th c. and newer) material which can usually be checked out. Depending on your research topic you may find useful maps in both collections. Library staff in both branches are available to help you locate and work with relevant collection material regardless of where it is physically stored.

### Digital images of maps
Digital map images can be used in a variety of ways and incorporated into web-based interactives, presentations, and storytelling platforms. 

Digital map images are even more useful when they have been georeferenced, meaning that information about the location of the place represented on the map has been incorporated into the digital file. This enables mapmaking software to correctly layer the map image over a contemporary base map so it can be combined with other geospatial information. 

Much of the material in our collections has been scanned and the images made available for use in various applications. We do not yet have digital images for everything in the collections but new material is added on an ongoing basis. 

Some collections are digital only, and Stanford does not possess the physical items. These images are acquired through *digital philanthropy*, where owners of maps allow us to use images of their collection materials.

Library staff can help you locate existing digital map images, get material scanned, georeference map images if necessary, and select and learn to use the right software tools for your project.

### Geospatial datasets and web maps 
Accessible through the Earthworks data portal, Stanford's collections include over 100k spatial datasets and cartographic resources, with over 60,000 of those freely available under permissive licensing. Through licensing agreements the **Stanford Geospatial Center** provides access to additional external datasets like Planet.com’s daily image of the Earth and those provided by SimplyAnalytics, a web-based mapping application using thousands of U.S. demographic, business, and marketing variables. Library and Stanford Geospatial Center staff are available to help you find and use relevant datasets, employ related tools like geocoding services, and select and learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to create maps and data visualizations.

## Types of Cartographic Resources
*Stanford Libraries continually evaluates and improves its collections of information resources based on the needs of our researchers, educators, and learners. Below are some of the different types of collections you will find in the library, as well as why they might be an important component to your work.*

*Links at the end of each section lead to material in Stanford Libraries' collections unless otherwise indicated.*

*Categories courtesy of [Eva Dodsworth's 2018 "A Research Guide to Cartographic Resources"](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/14278618); new sections will be added over time.*

### Atlases

"An atlas is a collection of information in a graphic format, consisting of text, tables, graphs, and accompanying maps used to describe an area. It provides a comprehensive look at a geographical region, whether the world, a country, a state or province, a county or city, or specific areas of interest such as a watershed or park."

"General atlases...show physical and political features of individual countries or groups of countries, highlighting topics such as physical geography, economic activities, demographics, and climate."

"Thematic atlases cover a specific subject, such as geology, hydrology, military history, ornithology, climatology, railroads, land ownership, land use, (or) forestry...(and) concentrate on a specific area, which can range from a small community, to a continent."

Typically "atlases are categorized by scale: continent, nation, state or province, and county."[^1]

### Topographic, City, and Town Maps

"Topographic maps are general-purpose maps that are detailed and accurate graphic representations of both human-made and natural features on the earth’s surface, including toponyms, administrative boundaries, and cultural, hydrographical, relief, and vegetation-based information."  [^2]

"City and town maps depict urban areas, recording the evolution and growth of cities over time...This map category includes cadastral maps, land ownership plans that show boundaries and ownership of land including owner names, parcel numbers, certificate of title numbers, positions of existing structures, lot numbers, and more."  [^3]

### Railroad, Road, and Other Transportation Maps

"(Historic) maps that show specific, established routes of travel, whether by road, rail, waterway, or flight line, are a great way to see what the options for past journeys might have been and to narrow down the specifics of possible point to point routes via a particular mode in a certain period of time and place."

### Geological Maps

"Geological maps represent the distribution of rock formations beneath the soil and other materials on the earth's surface. ... Many kinds of geological maps exist, including those emphasizing surficial features, bedrock and sediment, subsurface rocks, and geophysical features such as heat flow and gravity...Geological mapping is conducted mostly by government agencies at the national *(e.g. USGS)* and state levels." [^5]

[^5]: Dodsworth p123

"Geologic maps often serve as the foundation or starting point for derivative or topical research such as resource studies (groundwater, energy, metallic and industrial minerals) and geohazard portfolios. Today most geologic maps are produced in digital forms such as geographic information system (GIS) databases, downloadable Internet files, and interactive website maps that provide users with many options, increasing availability and usefulness." [^6]

### Bird's-Eye View Maps

"A bird's-eye view map is an elevated oblique-angled view of a geographic area from above, often drawn from a photograph. ... They are an artist's representation of what a specific geographic area looked like at a specific point in time and are generally not drawn to scale."

A bird's-eye view "provides large-scale detailed drawings of residential and industrial buildings, trees, gardens, horse-drawn carriages, even ships and trains. The details seen in these drawings enable researchers to see whether homes had garages, additions, and trees, as well as to determine the street names at the time of production."[^7]

### Geospatial Data Sources

"Geographic information generally consists of facts, data and/or exidence pertaining to events, activities and things located on (or near) the surface of the earth." [^8]

Datasets include the kinds of information seen on paper maps but made available as numeric or text values associated with locations and attributes, and arranged as tabular data or grouped in database files.
