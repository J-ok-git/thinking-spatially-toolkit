# Tools

There are a wide variety of tools available for working with and visualizing spatial data. The selections below are some of the most commonly used tools around.

### Desktop GIS Software

Traditional desktop tools for working with spatial data. These tools are designed to allow you to have full control over complex data and analysis workflows.

- ArcGIS Pro - Commercial desktop GIS from Esri. Power tools, lots of documentation and tutorials to learn from. Part of a larger GIS ecosystem. Works on Windows PCs only.
- QGIS - Free and open source GIS application. Supported by a large community of enthusiastic developers and users. Good tutorials available, but less well documented compared to Esri tools. Works on Mac, PC, and Linux.

### Web mapping

Web based tools for creating dynamic and interactive web maps. Some analysis capabilities may exist, but these are primarily tools for interactive visualizations and data sharing.

- Google My Maps -
- Google Earth Web -
- ArcGIS Online -
- Felt maps -

## Storytelling

Web tools for sharing narratives in map form. Media rich templates that combine interactive maps with text, images, video, and links.

- ArcGIS Story Maps - Infinite scroll or “scrollytelling” interface for sharing text, images, video, sound, and interactive maps. Part of the ArcGIS Online suite of apps.
- StoryMaps JS - Open source web map tool that combines an interactive basemap with slides that can contain text images and links to help viewers navigate through a map based narrative.
