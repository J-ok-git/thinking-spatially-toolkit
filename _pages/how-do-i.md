### What is the difference between davidrumsey.com and SearchWorks? How do I know which maps I van view in person at Stanford Libraries?
[Search for the "pub list no." from davidrumsey.com in SearchWorks and filter your results to the David Rumsey Map Center. If your search comes up empty, we most likely have not received the map from David yet.] [Should we just encourage people to do a title search? Aren't pub list numbers altered more frequently than titles in the case of atlas plates?]

{: .question}
### Where can I find datasets to use in a project?
[ArcGIS, Earthworks, data.gov]


## Accessing
{: .question}
### How can I include images of maps from your collections in my paper, resentation, digital exhibit, art project, or publication?
[Download links on Searchworks & DR.com; direct linking using IIIF; exporting map images from ArcGIS. Permissions?]

## Using
{: .question}
### How should I identify or cite maps I use in my academic work?
[Examples; description of acceptable uses]

## Combining
{: .question}
### How can I add my data to Google Maps or a similar web map?
[Felt maps, ArcGIS Online, Google Earth Web, StoryMaps JS, Leaflet, Mapbox, OpenLayers, Tetc...]

## Getting Help
{: .question}
### Who can I talk to at Stanford Libraries about making a map?
[SGC for cartographic production assistance, Branner and DRMC for basics (examples, tool/app support, etc.)]

{: .question}
### How can I learn more about GIS?
[SGC resources like...]

## Presenting
{: .question}
### How can I georeference a map to show as a digital map overlay? In other words, how can I make geographic comparisons between a modern and historical map?
[Information about QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, Allmaps, Georeferencer, etc. Maybe GDAL2tiles.py? Introduce concept os georeferencing, tools and examples]

There are several ways to go about this. Tutorials below are arranged with the easiest one at the top and become more complex as you go down the list. 

- [How to Georeference a Map in Allmaps to Display in Felt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYLQePTx8Cdcke4MZjFw1Kr0r6Isc1J_cki2JZRnUso/edit?usp=sharing)
  - *Simple tutorial for creating a georeferenced overlay of a historical map image on a contemporary basemap in Felt.com, a cloud-based GIS application.*
 
- [Georeferencing in QGIS](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e8d1d13ca8894643970f315d16010ee9)
  - *Learn to georeference historical maps in QGIS, a desktop GIS application, resulting in a more precise alignment between map image and location.*
