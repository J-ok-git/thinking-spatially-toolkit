**Questions about spatial processes or concepts?** This is why we are here. Below are a set of common questions we hear, and an answer to get you started in the right direction.

## Discovery

{: .question}

<details>
  <summary><b><em>How can I find interesting or relevant maps in Stanford's collections?</em></b></summary>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>You can search for maps in Stanford's collections using <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">SearchWorks</a>, the library's online catalog. You can also explore the <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/" target="_blank">David Rumsey Map Collection</a> for a wide range of historical maps. If you need help finding maps, you can <a href="/contact">reach out to us</a> for assistance.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b><em>What is the difference between davidrumsey.com and SearchWorks? How do I know which maps I van view in person at Stanford Libraries?</em></b></summary>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>David Rumsey is a map collector with a collection of maps that he has digitized and made available online. SearchWorks is the Stanford Libraries catalog, which includes maps from the David Rumsey collection as well as other maps in the library's collections. You can view maps in person at Stanford Libraries by checking the item's location in SearchWorks or contacting the library for more information.</p>

<details>
  <summary><b><em>Where can I find spatial datasets to use in a project?</em></b></summary>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>There are many places to find spatial datasets online. Stanford Libraries offers access to a wide range of spatial data resources, including the <a href="https://earthworks.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">EarthWorks</a> geospatial data discovery tool. You can also explore the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a> for geographic data.

<details>
  <summary><b><em>How do I see a map in person at the Library?</em></b></summary>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>You can request maps from the David Rumsey Map Center for viewing in the reading room. [More information on how to request maps.]</p>

    <p>Branner Library is an open stack collection, meaning you can browse the collection in person. [More information on visiting Branner Library.]</p>

    <p>If a map from Stanford Libraries has been scanned and made available to you in <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">SearchWorks</a>, you can read the permissions statements on their page. Permissions statements will tell you how the map can be used, how to acknowledge it in your work, and who to contact for more information. Most of the time, there is a link to download the map image directly on its page. [Download links on Searchworks & DR.com; direct linking using IIIF; exporting map images from ArcGIS. Permissions?]</p>

<details>
  <summary><b><em>How can I map a set of addresses?</em></b></summary>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates that can be used to create a map. The recommended resource for starting your geocoding work at Stanford is the <a href="https://guides.library.stanford.edu/sgc/services" target="_blank">Stanford Geospatial Center's Geocoding Services for Research Guide</a>.</p>
      
    <p>There are several ways to map a set of addresses. You can use a GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS to geocode the addresses and create a map. You can also use online mapping tools like Google Maps or Mapbox to create a map of your addresses.
